# Spotify Streaming Data Parsing Website

## TODO
* better popup on failure
* script to run everything
* Docker images to run scripts in
* fix uploading multiple times (need to refresh page to reupload)
* clean up frontend folder
* when searching, keep original row numbers
* add ability to select a specific range in time
* sorting by different columns doesn't work in album/artist popup
* exit album/artist popup by clicking outside of the popup
* favorite song on a rolling window of most listened to song in the last 1 month (DUDE!!!)
* play the song (ideally with spotify?) when you click on it (maybe with a play button)
* when merging data from a single and a song from an album, default to using the album

Feature not a bug :tm:
* when switching tabs, arrow stays sorting on whatever you were sorting by on the last tab
