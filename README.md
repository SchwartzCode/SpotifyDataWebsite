# Spotify Streaming Data Parsing Website

## TODO
* better popup on failure
* script to run everything
* Docker images to run scripts in
* Add page explaining how to request your data from spotify
* Add ability to aggregate data by album or artist
* Add ability to view a particular song/artist/album by time (thinking barchart by month like [in here](https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/dashboard))
* Is it possible to have all the data stored by chrome or something? Don't want all this shit in aws

* clear out shadcn stuff I'm not using (looking at you, sidebar)
